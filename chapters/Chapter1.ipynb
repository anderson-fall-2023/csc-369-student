    "As is the case in many fields, the term distributed computing has varied defintions. For this course, we will discuss both loosely coupled distributed systems and tightly coupled distributed systems. The terms \"distributed computing\", \"parallel computing\", and \"concurrent computing\" all have some overlap though distinctions are often made in context. An example of a loosely coupled distributed system is the client-server model shown. An example of a tightly coupled distributed system is performing a parallel computation on two cpus (or cores) in a single computer. "

Even if we weren't in a learning mode, we would still focus on small case studies. Why? Even in the real world we test on small subsets of data before scaling up. All of the examples throughout this class are scaled down representations of a real problem that may require distributed computing depending on time and resources. We have resources available if/when your project requires such a system."

    "Gluster is one of many distributed file systems that are used to organize and access large datasets and files. We'll discuss additional distributed file systems such as the Hadoop Distributed File System in subsequent chapters. Gluster was chosen because of its community support and industry adoption. Its goal is to provide a file system for applications needing scale-out storage and high-reliability. In other words, it is designed for applications that do not fit the traditional client-server model of file systems such as NFS."
